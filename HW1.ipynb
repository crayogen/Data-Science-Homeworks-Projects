    "For this homework we'll be looking at the data released by the State Bank of Pakistan. The data is the daily bank-wise and donor-wise receipts of the fund for the Daimer Bhasha and Mohmand Dam. You can find them in the following link: http://www.sbp.org.pk/notifications/FD/DamFund/Damfund.htm. Take a moment to look around the data and try to figure out what the possible challenges could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this homework is to teach how to scrape data from the web, clean it, and import it into Pandas for data analysis purposes. There are however some things to note:\n",
    "1. As you can tell, the data is in PDF form. PDF is the most difficult to handle data format and if you get extremely broken CSV files, there isn't a need to worry, that's where the cleaning part comes in.\n",
    "2. We'll be using an API to convert the data from PDF to CSV, and then from CSV to Pandas. There are, however, other ways to do this. The reason we wanted to do this method is two-fold\n",
    "    * It will teach you how to communicate with APIs using Python, which will be a useful skill when you want to deploy your data models as an API so that it can work with other APIs that need those data models. Moreover, a lot of data you get in the real world is from APIs. \n",
    "    * The CSV will be extremely inconsistent, so it will give you immense practice with using regular-expressions, which are extremely important in the Data Science tool-kit.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Submit the notebooks in a similar format to the Labs: print the relevant output in each cell **only if it has an output. The initial scraping and converting does not have any output**, and name the notebooks as:\n",
    "**rollnumber_HW1.ipynb** for e.g **20100237_H1.ipynb**\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure you complete full parts (denoted by a Header each in this notebook) as the grading will be based on parts. Needless to say, do not copy someone else's code. In most Data Science careers, the main skill is not how good you are at coding, but how well you are able to use the tools at your disposal and what inferences you are able to make with the information that you have. Thus, while you might be able to do the HW by looking at someone else's code, unless you go through the actual thought process, you won't learn a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using a lot of libraries in this tutorial, make sure you go through them so you understand what they are used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: If you are more comfortable doing so, as I am, you can do the assignment on your preferred text editor on simple Python and then write the code neatly in a notebook.** Personally, I find Sublime/Vim easier to use than Jupyter, mostly since a lot of shortcuts there make coding much easier, while here the shortcuts are more about navigation and controlling your cells.\n",

Are there any inconsistencies? Any particular values that pop out that would need to be taken care of later in your cleaning? Think of all these questions when going through the initial PDF because they will prove really helpful when you can not figure out why there are so many \"NaN\" values in your final DataFrame."

This [blog post](https://pdftables.com/blog/pdf-to-excel-with-python) will help you figure out how to convert the PDF to CSV using Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is perhaps the most difficult part of the assignment, you have to follow a similar strategy to what you did the Udacity Lab 1. You can not simply use Pandas read_csv since the conversion is not perfect and there will be rows with different number of columns, which Pandas does not take care of.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Main Task:**\n",
    "* Write a function that parses a CSV into a Pandas DataFrame\n",
    "* Each DataFrame should consist of three columns with headers Bank, Donor_Name, and Amount\n",
    "* The date should be retrieved from the given filename \n",
    "* The Donor_Name can be NaN, as it is in a lot of cases. But try to retrieve as much information as possible\n",
    "* Remove all \"Page of\" rows\n",
    "* Don't include the header rows (e.g. \"SUPREME COURT FUND....\") into the DataFrame\n",
    "* The Amount should be converted into a Pandas numeric at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other info:\n",
    "Some important resources for this part are (you can choose any one tutorial that you feel is easy to understand, they all cover roughly the same content):\n",
    "* [RegEx Tutorial 1](https://www.regular-expressions.info/)\n",
    "* [RegEx Tutorial 2](https://regexone.com/lesson/introduction_abcs)\n",
    "* [RegEx Tutorial 3](https://www.rexegg.com/)\n",
    "* [RegEx Cheatsheat](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285)\n",
    "* This [RegEx Editor](https://regex101.com/) is your best friend since you can test your expression separately on this\n",
    "\n",
    "You will probably have to use the CSV reader in order to get all the rows of the file. You can learn more about it using this [tutorial](https://www.alexkras.com/how-to-read-csv-file-in-python/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips:\n",
    "* First find out how many columns are in each row\n",
    "* Print out rows which are longer than they should be (they should all be of length 3)\n",
    "* Try to find patterns in how the data is spread, and what common problems exist in all rows\n",
    "* Write some regex to try an extract the amount from the problem row and then:\n",
    "    * Put the amount as the third column\n",
    "    * Merge the rest of the string as a name of the donor in the 2nd column\n",
    "* Also check if the rows with 3 columns are correctly formatted or not, many of them would probably not be."
